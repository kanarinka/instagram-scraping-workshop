Now there’s a statistic no one publishes. 
.
It can’t be 50% can it? Otherwise the acquisitions numbers wouldn’t look as bad as they do (remember, as per Artnet News’s 2019 study, acquisitions for work by female artists peaked in 2009, showing no discernible upward trend). 
.
As the Guerilla Girls said, you can buy one Jasper Johns for the same price as SIXTY SIX works by female artists, so my gut feeling is even if the acquisition numbers are the same (i.e. a museum acquires six pieces in a given year, three women, three men) the percentage of the budget skews male. @metmuseum @themuseumofmodernart @whitneymuseum @sfmoma, am I right?
