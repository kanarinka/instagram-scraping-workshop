I feel so honored to have moderated a panel @parkavearmory #100Years100Women with such an incredible and inspiring group of women: @kemi70 @teacherbell @zoebuckman spoke about neon uteruses, the @chinatownartbrigade, caring for the audience, artist Alexandra Bell, surfacing lesser known histories of people of color, @faithringgold and so much more!
