I’m so honored to publish this new article co-written with Dr. Katlyn Turner and  @space.enabled who are based at the @mitmedialab. It is called “The Abuse and Misogynoir Playbook” and details how the firing of #TimnitGebru from @google comes straight out of a centuries-old playbook used to try to silence Black women who speak truth to power. It was just published in the State of AI Ethics Report Jan 2021 by Montreal AI Ethics Institute. Beautiful diagram by @mqqt_
