I’m thinking a lot about this quote from @adriennemareebrown right now in the context of participating in mutual aid work in my town. It’s really inspiring work and there is a lot of need and amazing folks participating. But there have been detractors who don’t want to give people cash when that’s what they request or who accuse us of falling into traps of people who are scamming us “pretending to be single mothers” or who want to make sure that people will spend money well. This is frustrating. I think if people say they need money then they need money. It’s nobody’s business what they need it for or how they will use it. The purpose of mutual aid is to trust the people to speak their needs and then try to meet those needs collectively.
