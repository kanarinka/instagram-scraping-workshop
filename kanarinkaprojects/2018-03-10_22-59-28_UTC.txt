My MOST MAJOR fangirl moment - I got to moderate a conversation at MIT Women’s UnConference with #TamikaMallory - social justice leader, co-organizer of the Women’s March. So appreciate her words of wisdom about showing up for each other across lines of difference. About curing bullying with love and contact.
