Walking by the @mitpress bookstore today I had my first sighting of DATA FEMINISM - the book that @proleptic and I have been working on for several years. It is so, so satisfying to hold the real thing in my hands, turn the pages, love on it. Many thanks to all the people who helped us get to this point. And to my cat. Couldnâ€™t have done it without her. (I have two cats but the one who really helped - well, you know which one you are)
