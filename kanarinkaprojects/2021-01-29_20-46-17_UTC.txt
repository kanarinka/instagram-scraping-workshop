Today is my partnerâ€™s birthday and I made this! Among many sad times of the pandemic was our little Covid kitten who passed away of a congenital heart condition at the age of 5 months. We have a special rock in the neighborhood to remember him - the Oz Rock. Whenever we walk by we touch the rock and say hello. So this is the magic Oz Rock and the majestic Oz kitten beaming up and down from his sky business.
