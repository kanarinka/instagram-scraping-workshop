WOMXN TAKE THE STREETS

WEDNESDAY AUGUST 12TH, 2020 7:00 PM

Currently, only 7% of the people commemorated in Cambridgeâ€™s street names are women. A fraction of these are women of color. 

 

Join us for an intergenerational conversation on how to create more just and equitable public spaces in Cambridge; where the lives and voices of Cambridge womxn are uplifted and our streets, monuments, and memorials better reflect the rich diversity of our city.

 Councillor E. Denise Simmons @e_denisesimmons 

Professor Catherine D'Ignazio, Director of the MIT Data + Feminism Lab

MIT @mitdusp and Harvard Urban Planning students, Clara Amenyo, Osamu Kumasaka & Lenna Johnsen, who highlighted these disparities by creating an Instagram filter, street map, and playing cards featuring Cambridge women.
