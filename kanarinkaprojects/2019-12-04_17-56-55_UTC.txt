I had the pleasure of doing a keynote at the Smart City Expo World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, in November 2019, thanks to the kind invitation of @digitalfems and the organizers of the Inclusive and Sharing Cities track at the conference. 
Reuters covered our session with the great headline, “Smart cities urged to look beyond rich white men.”
