Call for Participation: Apply now for Feminist Future(s)!

This May, we invite you to join our month-long hackathon and community event series where we will practice care, collectivity, and radical imagination to dream and build feminist future(s) in which people and the planet thrive. In teams mentored by community organizations, we will design interventions for four topic areas:

Reproductive Justice
The Care Economy
Prison Abolition
Environmental Justice 

From art activism, to community gardens, to planning for mutual aid, we know that innovation doesn’t need to be high-tech to be high-impact. While we’re all tired of Zoom, we aim to create a virtual space that is caring, inclusive, and joyful. What's more, we want to recognize that participation is labor! Each of our 50 participants will receive a $250 stipend for the month.

Apply by March 26 — WWW.OURFEMINISTFUTURES.COM
