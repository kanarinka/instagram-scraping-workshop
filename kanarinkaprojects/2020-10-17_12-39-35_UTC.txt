DATA AGAINST FEMINICIDE is a series of events in November organized by myself, @silvana_fumega / @ildalatam, @ladelentesuy / @feminicidiouruguay. Events are interactive and designed to build solidarity amongst folks who work with / want to work with data about feminicide and gender-based violence. The main language of the event series is Spanish with live translation in English and Portuguese.
