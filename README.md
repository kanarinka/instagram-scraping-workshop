# instagram-scraping-exercise
 
This script & Jupyter notebook are for an Instagram scraping 101 workshop using the Python library [instaloader](https://instaloader.github.io).

The script allows you to set a hashtag, downloads media posts from Instagram with that hashtag, and downloads metadata for those posts into a spreadsheet (.csv file).

The Jupyter notebook pulls in that script and runs it. You can also just run the script from the command line if you are comfortable with that.
