# instagram-scraping-workshop
 
This script & Jupyter notebook are for an Instagram scraping 101 workshop using the Python library [instaloader](https://instaloader.github.io).

The script allows you to set a hashtag, downloads media posts from Instagram with that hashtag, and downloads metadata for those posts into a spreadsheet (.csv file).

The Jupyter notebook pulls in that script and runs it. You can also just run the script from the command line if you are comfortable with that. 

## Recommended use for newcomers
* Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
* Download and unzip these files
* Click on the IG Hashtag Scraper 101.ipynb to open and run it
* Note that you have to modify the USER, HASHTAG and LIMIT variables to get what you want out of it
